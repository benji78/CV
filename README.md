A github action updates my S3 bucket on AWS and invalidates cloudfront's cache when I commit to this repository.
I use OVH as my registrar and cloudfront as my DNS provider.

This online CV project was and still is a lot of fun particularly because I learned a lot from the many technologies I used to code and deploy it.
