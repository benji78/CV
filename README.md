A GitHub action updates my AWS S3 bucket and invalidates CloudFront's cache.
I use OVH as my registrar, Cloudflare as my DNS provider and CloudFront for fast content delivery.

This online CV project was and still is a lot of fun since I learned a lot from the many technologies I used to code and deploy it.
